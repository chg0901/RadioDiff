# RadioDiff Prompt Encoding Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of how prompt features are encoded in the RadioDiff framework, specifically examining the implementation in `train_cond_ldm.py` and validating the findings against the IEEE paper description. The analysis confirms that RadioDiff uses a 3-channel grayscale prompt system where each channel represents distinct environmental features (buildings, vehicles, and AP locations) that are processed through a sophisticated neural network architecture for conditional radio map generation.

## 1. Overview of RadioDiff Prompt Encoding

According to the IEEE paper (IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, 2025), RadioDiff models radio map construction as a conditional generative problem where:

> "The prompt is represented as a grayscale diagram with three channels, each channel depicting the features of buildings, vehicles, and AP. After encoding the prompt, it is concatenated into the U-Net network, enabling the model to generate RMs under environmental conditions."

The paper emphasizes that this approach allows the model to generate radio maps based on environmental features and base station locations as prompts for conditional generation.

## 2. Implementation Analysis

### 2.1 Data Loading and Prompt Construction

The prompt encoding process begins in the data loading pipeline (`lib/loaders.py`):

**Key findings from the code analysis:**

1. **Three-Channel Input Construction**: The prompt is constructed as a 3-channel tensor where:
   - Channel 0: Building information (`image_buildings`)
   - Channel 1: Transmitter/AP location (`image_Tx`) 
   - Channel 2: Vehicle information (`image_cars`) or building information (for non-vehicle scenarios)

```python
# From lib/loaders.py line 209-220
if self.carsInput=="no":
    inputs=np.stack([image_buildings, image_Tx, image_buildings], axis=2)
elif self.carsInput=="K2":
    inputs=np.stack([image_buildings, image_Tx, image_buildings], axis=2)
else: #cars
    inputs=np.stack([image_buildings, image_Tx, image_cars], axis=2)
```

2. **Normalization**: The prompt undergoes normalization to ensure stable training:
```python
self.transform_GY = transforms.Normalize(
    mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
    std=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
)
```

### 2.2 Neural Network Processing Architecture

The prompt processing occurs through a sophisticated multi-stage architecture in `mask_cond_unet.py`:

#### 2.2.1 Feature Extraction Backbone

The 3-channel prompt is processed through a pre-trained neural network backbone:

```python
# Default: Swin Transformer backbone
if cfg.cond_net == 'swin':  #默认用的是这个
    f_condnet = 128
    self.init_conv_mask = swin_b(weights=Swin_B_Weights)
```

**Available backbones:**
- **Swin Transformer** (default): 128 output channels
- **EfficientNet-B7**: 48 output channels  
- **ResNet-101**: 256 output channels
- **VGG-16**: 128 output channels

#### 2.2.2 Multi-Scale Feature Processing

The extracted features are processed at multiple scales through projection layers:

```python
self.projects = nn.ModuleList()
# Swin transformer projections
self.projects.append(nn.Conv2d(f_condnet, dims[0], 1))
self.projects.append(nn.Conv2d(f_condnet*2, dims[1], 1))
self.projects.append(nn.Conv2d(f_condnet*4, dims[2], 1))
self.projects.append(nn.Conv2d(f_condnet*8, dims[3], 1))
```

#### 2.2.3 Cross-Attention Integration

The core innovation lies in the `RelationNet` modules that integrate prompt features with the U-Net's latent representations:

```python
class RelationNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channel1=128, in_channel2=128, nhead=8, 
                 layers=3, embed_dim=128, ffn_dim=512):
        # Process prompt and U-Net features
        self.input_conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channel1, embed_dim, 1)
        self.input_conv2 = nn.Conv2d(in_channel2, embed_dim, 1)
        
        # Multi-head cross-attention layers
        self.attentions = nn.ModuleList([
            BasicAttetnionLayer(embed_dim=embed_dim, nhead=nhead, 
                             ffn_dim=ffn_dim, window_size1=window_size1, 
                             window_size2=window_size2, dropout=0.1)
            for i in range(layers)
        ])
```

### 2.3 U-Net Integration Mechanism

The prompt features are integrated into the U-Net architecture at multiple scales:

1. **Initial Concatenation**: Prompt features are concatenated with the noisy input at the U-Net entrance
2. **Multi-Scale Fusion**: `RelationNet` modules at each U-Net level perform cross-attention between prompt and U-Net features
3. **Bidirectional Processing**: Two parallel U-Net branches process different aspects of the prompt information

```python
# From forward pass in mask_cond_unet.py
hm = self.init_conv_mask(mask)  # Extract prompt features
x = self.init_conv(torch.cat([x, F.interpolate(hm[0], size=x.shape[-2:], mode="bilinear")], dim=1))

# Multi-scale integration
for i, ((block1, block2, attn, downsample), relation_layer) in enumerate(zip(self.downs, self.relation_layers_down)):
    x = block1(x, t)
    x = relation_layer(hm[i], x)  # Cross-attention integration
    x = block2(x, t)
```

## 3. Validation with IEEE Paper

2. **Backbone Processing**: Swin Transformer extracts hierarchical features
3. **Multi-Scale Projection**: Features projected to match U-Net dimensions
4. **Cross-Attention**: RelationNet modules integrate prompt and U-Net features
5. **Conditional Generation**: U-Net generates radio maps conditioned on prompt

### 4.2 Attention Mechanism

The `BasicAttetnionLayer` implements windowed multi-head attention:

```python
class BasicAttetnionLayer(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x1, x2):  # x1: prompt, x2: U-Net features
        # Position encoding
        qg = self.avgpool_q(x1) + self.pos_enc(qg)
        kg = self.avgpool_k(x2) + self.pos_enc(kg)
        
        # Multi-head attention
        qg = self.q_lin(qg).reshape(B, num_window_q, self.nhead, C1 // self.nhead)
        kg = self.k_lin(kg).reshape(B, num_window_k, self.nhead, C1 // self.nhead)
        vg = self.v_lin(kg).reshape(B, num_window_k, self.nhead, C1 // self.nhead)
        
        # Attention computation
        attn = (qg @ kg.transpose(-2, -1))
        attn = self.softmax(attn)
        qg = (attn @ vg)
```

### 4.3 Decoupled Diffusion Processing

The framework uses a decoupled diffusion model with two output branches:

```python
# Two-branch processing for decoupled diffusion
x1 = x + self.decouple1(x)  # Branch 1
x2 = x + self.decouple2(x)  # Branch 2

# Final outputs with skip connections
x1 = c_skip1 * x_clone + c_out1 * x1
x2 = c_skip2 * x_clone + c_out2 * x2
return x1, x2
```

## 5. Key Innovations

```python
class BlockFFT(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.fft.rfft2(x, dim=(2, 3), norm='ortho')
        x = x * torch.view_as_complex(self.complex_weight)
        x = torch.fft.irfft2(x, s=(H, W), dim=(2, 3), norm='ortho')
        return x
```
