## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of two IRT4 training sessions conducted on different dates with varying configurations. The analysis compares training performance, loss progression, configuration differences, and **includes detailed visualizations of the learning process through ground truth and generated sample pairs**. This enhanced analysis provides insights into the actual thermal image generation quality and training progression.

## Training Session Details

### Session 1: 2025-08-17 20:37
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Total Steps**: 50000
- **Learning Rate**: 5e-05 (decaying to 0)
- **Final Loss**: 0.251890
- **Minimum Loss**: 0.245290
- **Total Training Steps Completed**: 48000
- **Sample Pairs Generated**: 48
- **Training Duration**: Extended training with comprehensive sampling

### Session 2: 2025-08-17 21:44
- **Batch Size**: 16
- **Total Steps**: 10000
- **Learning Rate**: 5e-05 (decaying to 0)
- **Final Loss**: 0.485550
- **Minimum Loss**: 0.441280
- **Total Training Steps Completed**: 9500
- **Sample Pairs Generated**: 5
- **Training Duration**: Shorter training focused on initial convergence

## Performance Analysis

### Loss Progression Comparison

1. **Initial Performance**: Both sessions started with similar initial loss values (~7.7-7.9), indicating consistent model initialization.

2. **Convergence Rate**: 
   - Session 1 showed steady convergence over 47,500 steps
   - Session 2 achieved faster initial convergence but was limited to 9,500 steps

3. **Final Performance**:
   - Session 1 achieved a lower final loss (0.251890)
   - Session 2 reached 0.485550 in fewer steps

### Configuration Impact

The key differences in configuration were:
- **Batch Size**: Session 1 used 32, Session 2 used 16
- **Training Duration**: Session 1 trained for 50K steps, Session 2 for 10K steps
- **Save Frequency**: Session 1 saved every 1000 steps, Session 2 every 2000 steps

### Observations

1. **Batch Size Effect**: The larger batch size in Session 1 may have contributed to more stable training and better final performance.

2. **Training Duration**: Session 1's extended training allowed for better convergence and lower final loss.

3. **Loss Patterns**: Both sessions showed similar loss progression patterns, indicating consistent training behavior.

## Recommendations

1. **For Future Training**: Consider using the larger batch size (32) for more stable training
2. **Training Duration**: Extend training to at least 40K steps for better convergence
3. **Monitoring**: Continue monitoring loss_simple as the primary metric for training progress
