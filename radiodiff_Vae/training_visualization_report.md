### Analysis:
This multi-axis plot reveals the true magnitude differences with proper scaling:
- **KL Loss** (Red, Right Axis): Dominates in magnitude (139K-165K range)
- **Total Loss** (Blue, Left Axis): Secondary component (-1,922 to 2,927 range)
- **Reconstruction Loss** (Green, Far Right Axis): Small but critical (0.01-0.04 range)

The independent y-axes show that despite vastly different scales, all components are behaving correctly and contributing to the overall training objective.
